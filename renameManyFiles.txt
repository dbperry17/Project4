To make sure it's coded correctly:

	for filename in *foo*; do echo mv \"$filename\" \"${filename//foo/bar}\"; done > rename.txt

(This prints the output to rename.txt without actually renaming anything.)

To actually do it once you're sure it's correct:

	for filename in *foo*; do mv "$filename" "${filename//foo/bar}"; done


Yes, the asterisks and quotation marks are included.
